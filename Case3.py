You are given a string w, and a single character c.
c is equal to either S or D.

You need to print the word w as many times as the length of w. You print w once and then print w reversed, you print w once and then print w reversed and so on...

if c equal to S you need to have spaces between each word.

if c equal to D you need to have line breaks between each word.
